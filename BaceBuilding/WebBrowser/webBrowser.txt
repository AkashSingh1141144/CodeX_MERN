what is web browser ? ------------------------------------->

A web browser is a software application that allows us to access and view websites on the Internet. It helps us open web pages, search for information, watch videos, read news, and use online services.

Some of the most popular web browsers are:

Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Microsoft Edge
Safari (used in Apple devices)
Opera

When we type a website address (like www.google.com) into the browser, it sends a request to a server and then displays the website on the screen. Web browsers can also open multiple websites at the same time using tabs.
