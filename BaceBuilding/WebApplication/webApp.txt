what is Web Application ? -------------------------------------->

A web application is a software or program that runs in a web browser. It is accessed through the Internet using websites like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Unlike traditional software that needs to be installed on a computer, a web application runs online, and users can use it just by visiting a website.

Some common examples of web applications are:

Gmail – for sending and receiving emails
Google Docs – for writing and editing documents online
YouTube – for watching and uploading videos
Facebook or Instagram – for social networking

Web applications work on both computers and mobile phones. They usually have two parts:
Front-end – What the user sees (buttons, text boxes, images)
Back-end – Where the actual data is processed and stored (on a server)

A web application requires:
A web server to manage requests
A database to store information

Client-side and server-side coding to make it work
