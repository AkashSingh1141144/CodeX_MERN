What is API ? --------------------------------------->

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows two software applications to talk to each other. It acts like a messenger that takes a request from one program, sends it to another, and then returns the response.

💡 Simple Example:
Imagine you are at a restaurant:
You (the user) look at the menu (the front-end).
You place an order to the waiter (the API).
The waiter takes your order to the kitchen (the back-end).
The kitchen prepares the food and the waiter brings it back to you.
Here, the waiter is the API — he connects the customer (user interface) and the kitchen (server).

🛠️ What API Does:
Sends requests to the server (like "Get data", "Add data", "Delete data")

Receives data from the server and gives it to the front-end

Makes communication between front-end and back-end easier and safer

📱 Real-Life Examples:
Weather apps use APIs to get weather data from a weather server

Login with Google/Facebook uses APIs to connect to those services

Online payment systems like Razorpay or PayPal use APIs to process payments
