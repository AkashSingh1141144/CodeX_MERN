what is Front-End? ------------------------------------------->

The Front-End is the part of a website or web application that the user sees and interacts with directly. It includes everything that is shown on the screen — like text, images, buttons, menus, and forms. The front-end is also called the "client-side" because it runs on the user's device, inside a web browser.

🌐 Examples of Front-End:
The layout of a website
Navigation bar, buttons, and forms
Animations and slideshows
Colors, fonts, and design

🛠️ Technologies Used in Front-End:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – Used to create the basic structure of a web page.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – Used to design and style the web page (colors, layout, fonts).

JavaScript – Used to make the website interactive (like clicking a button, showing a pop-up, etc.).



What is Backend? ------------------------------->

The Back-End is the part of a website or web application that users cannot see. It works behind the scenes and is responsible for storing, managing, and processing data. The back-end is also called the "server-side", because it runs on a server, not in the user's browser.

🧠 What Back-End Does:
Stores data (like user details, messages, or products)
Responds to user actions (like login, search, or order)
Connects the front-end with the database
Ensures security and performance

🛠️ Technologies Used in Back-End:
Programming Languages:

Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby

Databases:

MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

Servers:

Handle requests and send data to front-end

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

Used to connect front-end with back-end

📦 Example:
When you log in to a website:

The front-end shows the login form.

The back-end checks your username and password in the database and sends a response back.
