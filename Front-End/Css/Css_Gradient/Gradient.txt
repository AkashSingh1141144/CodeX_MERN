CSS gradients let us create smooth transitions between colors using linear-gradient, radial-gradient, and conic-gradient. They improve design without loading external images and support multiple color stops and angles

| Type              | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `linear-gradient` | Colors transition in a straight line       |
| `radial-gradient` | Colors transition from a central point     |
| `conic-gradient`  | Colors rotate around a center (like a pie) |

we can use this in background-image property as background image;
