In CSS, color is used to define the text color, background, borders, and more. It's a key part of styling and design.

🔵 1. Color Properties in CSS
Here are the most commonly used CSS properties related to color:

Property ->	Purpose
color ->	Sets the text color
background-color	->  Sets the background color
border-color  ->	Sets the color of borders

🎨 2. Ways to Define Colors
There are several ways to specify colors in CSS:

1. Color Names
Use predefined color names like:
red, blue, green, black, white, orange, etc.
➡️ Easy to use but limited options.

2. HEX Codes
A 6-digit code beginning with #, representing red, green, and blue.
Example: #FF0000 for red
➡️ Used for web-safe, consistent color values.

3. RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
Use numeric values between 0 and 255:
Example: rgb(255, 0, 0) → red
➡️ Offers more control than color names.

4. RGBA (RGB + Alpha)
Same as RGB but includes alpha for transparency:
Example: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) → semi-transparent red
➡️ Used for layered and transparent UI elements.

5. HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
Colors based on hue angle (0–360), percentage saturation, and lightness:
Example: hsl(0, 100%, 50%) → red
➡️ Easier to adjust brightness or tone.

6. HSLA (HSL + Alpha)
Same as HSL with transparency:
Example: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.3) → semi-transparent green

🌟 3. Additional Notes for Interview
The currentColor keyword allows you to reuse the current text color.
transparent is a keyword that makes an element fully transparent.

CSS variables (custom properties) can store colors:
--primary-color: #3498db;
