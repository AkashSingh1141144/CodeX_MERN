âœ… 1. Simple Selectors
These are the most basic CSS selectors and are used to select HTML elements by their name, class, or ID.

Element Selector: Targets all HTML elements of a specific type (e.g., all <p> tags).

Class Selector: Selects all elements that have a specific class attribute. It is reusable across multiple elements.

ID Selector: Selects a single, unique element with a specific ID. An ID must be unique within a page.

ðŸ”¸ These selectors are the foundation of CSS styling and are used most frequently.



âœ… 2. Combinator Selectors
These selectors are used to select elements based on their relationship to other elements in the HTML structure.

Descendant Selector: Selects elements that are nested inside a specific element, at any depth.

Child Selector: Selects only the direct children of an element.

Adjacent Sibling Selector: Selects an element that comes immediately after a specific element (same parent).

General Sibling Selector: Selects all sibling elements that come after a specified element.

ðŸ”¸ Combinators are essential for targeting specific elements in nested structures.



âœ… 3. Pseudo-Class Selectors
Pseudo-classes define the special state of an element.

Examples include :hover, :focus, :first-child, :nth-child(), etc.

They allow you to style elements dynamically â€” for example, when a user hovers over a link or focuses on an input field.

ðŸ”¸ Pseudo-classes are useful for interaction-based styling and structural selection.




âœ… 4. Pseudo-Element Selectors
Pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an elementâ€™s content.

Examples include ::before, ::after, ::first-line, and ::first-letter.

These do not change the content but allow you to insert or style virtual content visually.

ðŸ”¸ They are ideal for adding decorative or formatting touches without extra HTML.



âœ… 5. Attribute Selectors
Attribute selectors target elements based on the presence or value of their attributes.

For example, you can select all elements with a type attribute or all links that open in a new tab.

These are especially useful in forms or dynamic components.

ðŸ”¸ They provide flexibility in targeting elements with specific behavior or properties.
