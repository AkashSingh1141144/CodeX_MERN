Each HTML element is treated as a rectangular box, which consists of the following four parts (from innermost to outermost):

Content
The actual text, image, or other content inside the element.

Padding
Space inside the box, between the content and the border.

Border
A line that wraps around the padding and content.

Margin
Space outside the border, separating the element from others.
