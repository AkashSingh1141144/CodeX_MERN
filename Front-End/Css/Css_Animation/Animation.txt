CSS Animation is a technique that allows HTML elements to change their style or position over time without using JavaScript. We define keyframes using @keyframes, and then apply those animations using the animation properties on an element. This is useful for creating smooth UI effects like sliding, fading, rotating, or loading indicators


"To control the animation, we use several key properties:------------
animation-name: links to the @keyframes block.
animation-duration: how long the animation runs.
animation-timing-function: controls the speed curve like ease, linear.
animation-delay: waits before animation starts.
animation-iteration-count: how many times the animation repeats (1, infinite).
animation-direction: like alternate to reverse back and forth.
animation-fill-mode: applies styles before/after the animation (e.g. forwards).
Or we use animation shorthand to combine them all."
