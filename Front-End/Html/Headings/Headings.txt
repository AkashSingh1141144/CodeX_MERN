âœ… What is a Heading in HTML?
Headings in HTML are used to define the titles or subtitles on a web page.

They help:
Make content easy to read,
Organize the structure of the page,
Improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

ðŸ”¹ HTML Provides 6 Levels of Headings:
Tag	Meaning	Size (Browser Default)
<h1>	Main heading (biggest)	Largest
<h2>	Sub-heading	Smaller
<h3>	Sub-sub-heading	Smaller
<h4>	Level 4 heading	Smaller
<h5>	Level 5 heading	Smaller
<h6>	Smallest heading	Smallest


ðŸ“Œ Notes for Exams:
Use only one <h1> per page (main title).
Use headings in order to show structure.
Do not use headings just for making text bold or big â€” use them for meaningful sections.

ðŸ§  Tip:
Think of headings like a book:
<h1> = Book Title
<h2> = Chapter Title
<h3> = Section inside chapter

And so on...
